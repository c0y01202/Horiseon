Code Refactor Starter Code

Horiseon Website.

Purpose
The following project was a test to determine whether we could develop code and push it to Git Hub.

Built With:
HTML
CSS

Description of Work Flow

To begin I pulled files from Git Hub.

Opened the Develop folder and began to added hidden notes to the index.html and to the css file to make the code easier to read. 

Added an "aside" element to the style.css file to simplify the css style sheet.

Eliminated redundancy in the style.css sheet.

Added a privacy Policy HTML page which links to the index.html page with updated content.

Saved and viewed files in VS Code browser.

Applied meaning, context, and functionality to HTML elements by using HTML attributes.

Used Git to create a repository for the project.

Used GitHub to create a remote location for the repository, and then published the project to GitHub Pages for others to see.

The purpose of the Horiseon website is to market a company that specialzies in Internet marketing.
